		The present project reports the building process of an interactive computational work of art which uses light as its main source of aesthetical constitution. It is based on a grid of LEDs which light up as the spectator walks below them. Its main components are the Microsoft Kinect, which detects the presence of the spectator, an Arduino board, which controls the LEDs grid, and a computer with Processing
